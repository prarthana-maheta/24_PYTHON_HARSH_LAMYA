# Write a Python program that iterates the
# integers from 1 to 50. For multiples of three
# print "Fizz" instead of the number and for
# multiples of five print "Buzz". For numbers 
# that are multiples of three and five, print "FizzBuzz".

# Sample Output :
# fizzbuzz
# 1
# 2
# fizz
# 4
# buzz


# Write a Python program to convert a month name to a number of days.
# Expected Output:

# List of months: January, February, March, April, May, June, July, August
# , September, October, November, December                                
# Input the name of Month: February ,April                                      
# No. of days: 28/29 days 

# No.of days: 31 days


# Write a Python program to get the next day of a given date.
# Expected Output:

# Input a year: 2016                                                      
# Input a month [1-12]: 08                                                
# Input a day [1-31]: 23                                                  
# The next date is [yyyy-mm-dd] 2016-8-24   


program to get the Fibonacci series between 0 and 50.
Note : The Fibonacci Sequence is the series of numbers :
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, ....
Every next number is found by adding up the two numbers before it.
Expected Output : 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34
